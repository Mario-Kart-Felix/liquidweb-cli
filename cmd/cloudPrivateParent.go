A Private Parent is a physical hypervisor node that you fully own. No one else but you
will be able to provision Cloud Servers on a Private Parent. In addition, with Private
Parents you have total control of how many instances can live on the Private Parent,
as well as how many resources each Cloud Server gets.

Private Parents must use a config of category 'bare-metal' or 'bare-metal-r'. For a list
of configs, check 'cloud server options --configs'.

For a full list of capabilities, please refer to the "Available Commands" section.`,
