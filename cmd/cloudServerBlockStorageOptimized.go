	Long: `Cloud Block Storage Optimized actions.

A Cloud Server uses more memory when using Cloud Block Storage volumes. Normal
Cloud Servers have enough pad for this to not be an issue, but Cloud Dedicated
purposely runs very tight. To work around this we can reduce the RAM allocated
to the Cloud Server to give more to the hypervisor. We call this Cloud Block
Storage Optimized.

Enabling or disabling Cloud Block Storage will cause your Cloud Server to reboot.

For a full list of capabilities, please refer to the "Available Commands" section.`,
